		<h1>Accounting</h1>
		<p>
<b><i>Accounting </i></b>also known as accountancy, is the measurement, processing, and <br>
financial and non financial information about economic entities[1][2] such as businesses <br>
Accounting, which has been called the "language of business",[3] measures the results of <br>
an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of stakeholders,<br>
 including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[4] Practitioners of <br>
 accounting are known as accountants. The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" <br>

Accounting can be divided into several fields including financial accounting, management accounting, <br>
 accounting and cost accounting.[5][6] Accounting information systems are designed to support accounting <br>
 functions and related activities. Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's <br>
 information, including the preparation of financial statements, to the external users of the information, <br>
 such as investors, regulators and suppliers;[7] and management accounting focuses on the measurement<br>
 and reporting of information for internal use by management.[1][7] The recording of financial transactions, <br>
 so that summaries of the financials may be presented in financial reports, is known as bookkeeping, of which <br>double-entry bookkeeping is the most common system.[8]<br>

Accounting has existed in various forms and levels of sophistication throughout human history. <br>
The double-entry accounting system in use today was developed in medieval Europe, particularly in Venice, <br>
and is usually attributed to the Italian mathematician and Franciscan friar Luca Pacioli. accounting is<br>
 facilitated by accounting organizations such as standard-setters, accounting firms and professional bodies.<br> Financial statements are usually audited by accounting firms,[10] and are prepared in accordance with<br> 
 accepted accounting principles (GAAP).[7] GAAP is set by various standard-setting organizations such as <br>
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United Statesand the Financial Reporting Council<br>
  in the United Kingdom.As of 2012, "all major economies" have plans to converge towards or adopt the<br>
   International Financial Reporting Standards <br>
